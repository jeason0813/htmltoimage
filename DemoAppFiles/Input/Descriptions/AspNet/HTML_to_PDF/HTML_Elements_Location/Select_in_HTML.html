<b>EVO HTML to PDF Converter</b> allows you to retrieve detailed information about any element of the HTML page. You can get the element tag name, CSS class name, ID, HTML code of the element and attributes. 
    You can select the elements for which to retrieve the information by adding the <i><b>data-mapping-enabled</b></i> attribute to element directly in HTML page. 
    Additionally you can set a unique ID for an element with <i><b>data-mapping-id</b></i> to help you find the element in the collection of retrieved elements.

At the top of the demo you can choose the HTML document to convert which can be:
    <br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>HTML Page to Convert URL</b>. The URL must be accessible from the computer where the converter runs. If the page requires authentication or if you are using a proxy server to access Internet
            then you have to set the converter properties accordingly as described in documentation
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>HTML String with Mapping Attributes</b>. When you convert a HTML string you also have the option to specify a base URL that will be used
            by converter to resolve the relative URLs found in the HTML string to fully qualified URLs. If your HTML string uses only fully qualified URLs then this parameter is not necessary
    </li>
</ul>
