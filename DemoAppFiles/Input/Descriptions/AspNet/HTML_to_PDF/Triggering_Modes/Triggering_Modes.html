<b>EVO HTML to PDF Converter</b> allows you to select when you want to start conversion of the HTML page to PDF. You can start conversion immediately after the page was loaded, 
    delayed after the page was loaded with a constant time interval or manually by calling the <i>evoConverter.startConversion()</i> method from the HTML page JavaScript code.<br />
<br />
At the top of the demo you can choose the HTML document to convert which can be:
    <br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>HTML Page URL or Local File to Convert</b>. The URL must be accessible from the computer where the converter runs. If the page requires authentication or if you are using a proxy server to access Internet
            then you have to set the converter properties accordingly as described in documentation
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>HTML String with Manual Triggering</b>. When you convert a HTML string you also have the option to specify a base URL that will be used
            by converter to resolve the relative URLs found in the HTML string to fully qualified URLs. If your HTML string uses only fully qualified URLs then this parameter is not necessary
    </li>
</ul>
