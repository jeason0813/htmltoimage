<b>EVO HTML to PDF Converter</b> allows you to add multiple HTML documents into a single PDF document. You can start with an empty PDF document represented by a Document object and then 
    for each HTML document you add a HtmlToPdfElement object to the PDF document. A HTML to PDF element can be added where the previous element ended or it can be added to a new PDF page.<br />
<br />
The options you can set in this demo are:
    <br />
<br />
<ul>
    <li>
        <b>First HTML Page URL</b>. This is the URL of the first HTML document to be added on the first page of the PDF document
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Second HTML Page URL</b>. This is the URL of the second HTML document to be added in PDF immediately after the first HTML document or on a new PDF page
            following the first HTML document
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Start the Second HTML on a New PDF Page</b>. As the name suggests this option allows you to choose if you want to add the second HTML document immediately 
            after the first HTML document or on a new PDF page following the first HTML document
    </li>
</ul>
